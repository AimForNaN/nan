# NaN micro framework

This is a collection of PHP scripts that I have written over the course of time which have proven useful, turned into a library.

Common components include:
 - Getter/setter functionality
 - REST/RPC
 - HTTP client
 - Session management
 - Collection (data structure)
 - DateTime (with basic holiday and business day support)
 - File system helpers
 - Image manipulation (GD wrapper)
 - Debugging
 - Database/ORM

### Code style

 - Namespace names: pascal case (with the exception of "NaN").
 - Class names: pascal case.
 - Function names: camel case.
 - Variable names: snake case.
 - Constants: macro case.

 - Opening curly brackets on the same line.
