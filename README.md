# NaN Framework

This is a collection of PHP scripts that I have written over the course of time which have proven useful and stable.

Here is a list of components that it includes:
 - Getter/setter functionality
 - RESTful APIs
 - HTTP header parsing (with basic cookie support)
 - HTTP Proxy (cURL wrapper)
 - Session management
 - Collection (data structure)
 - URL parser
 - DateTime (with basic holiday and business day support)
 - File system helpers
 - Image manipulation (GD wrapper)
 - Debugging
 - Database helpers (MySQL wrapper with prepared statements support)
