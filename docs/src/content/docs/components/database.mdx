title: Database
---

NaN provides its own database abstraction layer (DAL).
It is designed to be as database-agnostic as possible.
We provide fully-functional abstractions around PDO.
These abstractions only support the most commonly used SQL queries that share the same syntax found in the MySQL, Postgres and SQLite databases.
For more complex queries you'll have to write the queries raw or implement a more complex abstraction.
Likewise for any databases that don't share the same syntax.

For databases not supported by PDO you'll have to write your own driver.
