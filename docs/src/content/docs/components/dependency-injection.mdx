title: Dependency injection
---

Dependency injection is a way of dynamically injecting arguments into a callable.
In NaN, dependency injection is managed by the `NaN\DI` namespace.
It is PSR-11 compatible and is highly inspired by the PHP league's [container](https://container.thephpleague.com/4.x/) system, with some of the fat cut off and some adjustments made to help improve performance.

### Adding entries

You can conveniently and optionally add entries through the constructor.

```php
use NaN\DI\{Container, Definition, Definitions};

$container = new Container(new Definitions([
	SomeClassInterface::class => new Definition(SomeClass::class),
]));
```

You can also use the array-access operator to add definitions to the container.

```php
$container[SomeClassInterface::class] = new Definition(SomeClass::class):
```

The array keys act as aliases.
When aliases are provided, look-up time achieves a complexity of O(n), so long as delegates are not involved.
If an alias is not provided, the system will loop through all definitions until it finds a matching definition.
Without an alias it will only be able to match against a class that inherits from the hinted type on a FIFO basis.
Therefore, for best performance and predictability, be sure to always provide an alias and type hint using only that alias.

:::note

While aliases do not necessarily need to be fully-qualified class names,
	arbitrary aliases are only meaningful if you have direct access to the container instance since they can't be used for type hinting.

### Retrieving entries

As per the PSR-11 standard, entries can be retrieved through the `get` method.

```php
$entry = $container->get($alias);
```

You can also use the array-access operator to retrieve an entry.

```php
$entry = $container[$alias];
```

As per the PSR-11 standard, an exception will be thrown if an entry cannot be found when retrieving an entry.
You can check if an entry exists before retrieving or simply catch the exception.

```php
if ($container->has($alias)) {
	$entry = $container->get($alias);
}
```

```php
if (isset($container[$alias]) {
	$entry = $container->get($alias);
}
```

```php
use Psr\Container\NotFoundExceptionInterface;

try {
	$entry = $container->get($alias);
} catch (NotFoundExceptionInterface $ex) {
	// ...
}
```

### Delegates

Delegates allow multiple containers to work together when retrieving entries.
When a container cannot find a matching entry it will delegate the task to another container.
Since there is no global store of containers, each container will store their own delegates.

```php
$first_container = new Container();

$second_container = new Container(new Definitions([
	SomeClass::class => new Definition(SomeClass::class),
]));

$first_container->addDelegate($second_container);

// Will search $second_container if an entry can't be found!
$first_container->get(SomeClass::class);
```

### Definitions

##### Arguments

Some class constructors have parameters that need to be filled.
You can supply an array of arguments to be autowired into the class constructor.
The arguments must be in the same order as the definition of the class constructor.
Dependency injection will also work here, too, so long as a definition exists for the hinted types within the container.

```php
$container[SomeOtherClassInterface::class]
	= new Definition(SomeOtherClass::class);

$container[SomeClassInterface::class]
	= new Definition(SomeClass::class, ['argument', SomeOtherClass::class]);
```

##### Factories

Sometimes you need a little extra boilerplate than what can be provided through the `Definition` class.
In such cases you can use a function to act as a factory.
The container instance can be accessed through `$this`.

```php
$container[SomeOtherClassInterface::class]
	= new Definition(SomeOtherClass::class);

$container[SomeClassInterface::class] = new Definition(function () {
	/** @var \NaN\DI\Container $this */
	$dependency = $this->get(SomeOtherClassInterface::class);
	// Do some stuff...
	return $some_class;
}):
```

##### Single instance

Typically, when retrieving an entry, a new instance will be instantiated for any given factory or fully-qualified class name.

```php
$one = $container[SomeClassInterface::class];
$two = $container[SomeClassInterface::class];

($one === $two) === false;
```

Sometimes you may want the same instance every time you retrieve an entry.
For this we provide an optional third parameter: `shared`.
Pass in `true` if you want the same instance to be retrieved every, single time.

```php
$container[SomeClassInterface::class]
	= new Definition(SomeClass::class, [], true);
```

```php
$container[SomeClassInterface::class]
	= new Definition(SomeClass::class, shared: true);
```

```php
$one = $container[SomeClassInterface::class];
$two = $container[SomeClassInterface::class];

($one === $two) === true;
```

In the case where real values are used, the entries automatically become shared.

```php
$container[SomeClassInterface::class] = new Definition(new SomeClass());

$one = $container[SomeClassInterface::class];
$two = $container[SomeClassInterface::class];

($one === $two) === true;
```
