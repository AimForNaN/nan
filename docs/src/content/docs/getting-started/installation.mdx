### Requirements

 - PHP 8.1 or greater.
 - PDO extension.

### Composer

Because NaN is still experimental, you'll need to manually add the Git repository to your `composer.json` file.

```json title="composer.json"
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "git",
            "url": "https://github.com/AimForNaN/nan.git"
        }
    ]
}
```

After which, you can install the NaN micro-framework with composer.

```shell
composer require AimForNaN/nan
```
