The NaN application manages all services and middleware.
Upon running the application, all request data will be passed on to the middleware in exchange for a response.
The response will, therefrom, be processed to  be sent to the client.

### NaN application

At the core of every NaN application stands `NaN\App\App`.
It is a PSR-15-compatible request handler with support for services and middleware.

```php title="index.php"
use NaN\App\App;

$app = new App();

$app->run();
```

### Application-level services

Services can be conveniently and optionally registered through the `NaN\App\App` constructor.

```php
use NaN\DI\{Container, Definition, Definitions};

$app = new App(new Container(new Definitions([
	new Definition(CustomService::class),
])));
```

Services can also be later registered through the array-access operator.

```php
$app[] = new Definition(CustomService::class);
```

An instance of the service can be retrieved through the same array-access operator.

```php
$second_service = $app[CustomService::class];
```

These services will be available only on an application level (or wherever the `Container` instance is used).
As such, when working with routes they will only be retrievable through the `App` instance itself.
Any service you want access to from your routes should be registered through the NaN application.

### Application-level middleware

Middleware can be conveniently and optionally registered through the `NaN\App\App` constructor.

```php
use NaN\App\Middleware;
use NaN\App\Router\Router;

$router = new Router();

$app = new App($services, new Middleware([
	$router,
]));
```

Middleware can also be later registered through the traditional `use` method.

```php
$app->use($router);
```

##### Routing

In a NaN application, routing is treated as middleware.
Since all middleware must be registered with the application, a barebones application doesn't do much on its own.
The NaN router is PSR-15 compatible and can be used anywhere that follows the same middleware standard.
Each route will have access to its own parameters, an instance of the NaN application from which it was called, along with PSR-7-compatible request and response instances.

Every route must return a PSR-7-compatible response.

```php
use \Psr\Http\Message\{
	ResponseInterface as Response,
	ServerRequestInterface as Request,
};

$router['/'] = function (
	Response $response,
	Request $request,
	App $app,
) {
	return $response; // 200 status code by default!
};
```

### Further learning

While the examples on this page are sufficient to get you started, it's not necessarily the most efficient approach.
You stand to gain from a deeper understanding of the system.
