At the core of every NaN application stands `NaN\App`.
It is a PSR-15-compatible request handler with support for services and middleware.
Upon running the application, all request data will be passed on to the middleware in exchange for a response.
The response will, therefrom, be processed to  be sent to the client.

```php title="index.php"
use NaN\App;

$app = new App();

$app->run();
```

### Services

Services can be conveniently and optionally registered through the `NaN\App` constructor.

```php
use NaN\DI\Container;
use NaN\DI\Container\Entry;

$app = new App(new Container([
	CustomService::class => new Entry(CustomService::class),
]));
```

Services can also be later registered through the array-access operator.

```php
$app[CustomService::class] = new Entry(CustomService::class);
```

An instance of the service can be retrieved through the same array-access operator.

```php
$custom_service = $app[CustomService::class];
```

These services will be available only on an application level (or wherever the `Container` instance is used).
As such, the dependencies injected into the routes will come from the `App` instance that manages the route.
Any service you want access to from your routes should be registered through the NaN application.

### Middleware

Middleware can be conveniently and optionally registered through the `NaN\App` constructor.

```php
use NaN\App\Middleware;
use NaN\App\Middleware\Router;

$router = new Router();

$app = new App($services, new Middleware([
	$router,
]));
```

Middleware can also be later registered through the traditional `use` method.

```php
$app->use($router);
```

##### Routing

In a NaN application, routing is treated as middleware.
Since all middleware must be registered with the application, a barebones application doesn't do much on its own.
The NaN router is PSR-15 compatible and can be used anywhere that follows the same middleware standard.
Each route will have access to its own parameters,
	any services registered through the NaN application,
	along with PSR-7-compatible request and response instances.

Every route must return a PSR-7-compatible response.

```php
use \Psr\Http\Message\{
	ResponseInterface as Response,
	ServerRequestInterface as Request,
};

$router['/'] = function (
	Response $response,
	Request $request,
	// parameters and services...
) {
	return $response; // 200 status code by default!
};
```
