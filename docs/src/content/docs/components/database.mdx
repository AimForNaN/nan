title: Database
---

NaN provides its own database abstraction layer (DAL).
It is designed to be as database-agnostic as possible.
We provide fully-functional abstractions around PDO out-of-the-box.
These abstractions only support the most commonly used SQL queries that are shared among MySQL, Postgres and SQLite databases.
For more complex queries you'll have to write the queries raw or implement a more complex abstraction.
Likewise for any databases that don't share the same syntax.
For databases not supported by PDO you'll have to write your own driver.

## SQL driver

At the center of the NaN database abstraction layer stands the `NaN\Database\Drivers\SqlDriver` class.
It's a PDO abstraction that supplies its own query builder.
All configuration necessary to construct a PDO connection is provided through its constructor.
In it you must specify the type of driver to load.
The DSN for that driver is to be specified in a key whose name matches the driver name.
For example, if the driver is `sqlite`, then there must be a matching `sqlite` key.
The value can be either a string or an array of DSN properties.

```php
use NaN\Database\Drivers\SqlDriver;

$driver = new SqlDriver([
	'driver' => 'sqlite',
	'sqlite' => ':memory:',
]);
```

```php
$driver = new SqlDriver([
	'driver' => 'mysql',
	'mysql' => [
		'host' => 'localhost',
		'port' => 3306,
		'charset' => 'utf8mb4',
	],
]);
```

#### Authentication

For databases that require a username and password you may provide them in the relevant keys.

```php
$driver = new SqlDriver([
	'username' => 'root',
	'password' => '',
]);
```

#### PDO options

There may be times when you want to provide options for the PDO connection.
PDO options can be provided in the `options` key.

```php
$driver = new SqlDriver([
	'options' => [
		\PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES => false,
	],
]);
```

#### Connect to a database

To establish a connection you must call the `createConnection` method.
This will return a query builder that has access to the database connection (i.e. `PDO` instance).
You can use the first argument to pass data to the query builder for you to access at a later time.
The data can be accessed through the array-access operator.

```php
$query_builder = $driver->createConnection([
	'table' => 'table_name',
]);

$default_table = $query_builder['table'];
```

## Query builder

CRUD operations are represented by four specific concepts.

 - `Create` &#129106; `Push`.
 - `Retrieve` &#129106; `Pull`.
 - `Update` &#129106; `Patch`.
 - `Delete` &#129106; `Purge`.

These operations pertain only to table rows.
For operations outside the scope of table rows (e.g database schemas) or for more complex queries, you can execute raw queries.

```php
$query_builder->raw('CREATE TABLE `table_name`');
```

For raw prepared statements, bindings can be passed in the second argument.

```php
// Positional!
$query_builder->raw(
<<<SQL
	SELECT * FROM `tb1`
	LEFT JOIN `tb2`
	ON `tb1`.`id` = `tb2`.`tb1_id`
	WHERE `field` = ?
SQL, [
	'field value',
]);

// Parameterized!
$query_builder->raw(
<<<SQL
	SELECT * FROM `tb1`
	LEFT JOIN `tb2`
	ON `tb1`.`id` = `tb2`.`tb1_id`
	WHERE `field` = :value
SQL, [
	'value' => 'field value',
]);
```

The NaN database abstraction layer does not try to distinguish between prepared and non-prepared statements.
Instead, the system will activate prepared statements when bindings are supplied regardless of the query supplied.
Don't provide bindings if you aren't planning on using prepared statements.

##### Default table and database

The query builder reserves the `table` and `database` options for specifying the default table and database for all CRUD queries.
This only holds true if you use any of the CRUD methods of the query builder itself.
Manually constructing a CRUD class and executing it yourself will not make the same assumptions.

```php
$query_builder = $driver->createConnection([
	'table' => 'table_name',
	'database' => 'database_name',
]);

// Will assume table and database!
$query_builder->pull(...):

// Will *not* assume table and database!
$query_builder->exec(...);
```

### Pull

The pull operation is represented by the `NaN\Database\Query\Statements\Pull` class.
It is equivalent to the `SELECT` statement of the typical SQL query.
By default, the pull operation will select all columns.
If you need to select specific columns, use the `pull` method or the invokable.

```php
use NaN\Database\Query\Statements\Pull;

// `pull` method!
$query_builder->pull(function (Pull $pull) {
	$pull->pull([
		'column_one',
		'column_two',
	]);
});

// Invokable!
$query_builder->pull(function (Pull $pull) {
	$pull([
		'column_one',
		'column_two',
	]);
});
```

Alternatively, you can provide the columns into the constructor.

```php
$pull = new Pull([
	'column_one',
	'column_two',
]);
```

##### Aliases

You can use array keys as column aliases.

```php
$pull->pull([
	'column_one_alias' => 'column_one',
	'column_two_alias' => 'column_two',
]);
```

##### Distinct

You can mark the selection as distinct in the second argument.

```php
$pull->pull([
	'column_one_alias' => 'column_one',
	'column_two_alias' => 'column_two',
], true);
```

Or through the `distinct` method.

```php
$pull->distinct();
```

##### From clause

The `Pull` class provides basic abstraction for the `FROM` clause.
The `database` and `alias` arguments are optional.

```php
$pull->from('table', 'database', 'alias');
```

If you want to add sub queries, use a closure.
The `alias` argument is optional.

```php
$pull->from(function (Pull $pull) {
	$pull->from('table', 'database')->where('column', 'IN', [0, 1, 2]);
}, 'alias');
```

##### Where clause

The `Pull` class provides basic abstraction for the `WHERE` clause.

```php
$pull->where('column_two', 'IN', [0, 1, 2]);
```

You can also pass in a closure for more complex `WHERE` expressions.
Use the invokable to set the initial condition.
From there you can use `and` and `or` methods for more conditions.

```php
use NaN\Database\Query\Statements\Clauses\WhereClause;

$pull->where(function (WhereClause $where) {
	$where('column_one', '=', $value)->and('column_two', '=', $value_two);
});
```

Every sub closure will be treated as a sub group.

```php
$pull->where(function (WhereClause $where) {
	$where('column_one', '=', $value)->and(function (WhereClause $where) {
		$where('column_two', '=', $value_two)->or('column_two', '=', $value_three):
	});
});
```

##### Order-by clause

The `Pull` class provides basic abstraction for the `ORDER BY` clause.
The array keys represent column names and the array values represent the order.

```php
$pull->orderBy([
	'column_one' => 'desc',
	'column_two' => 'asc',
]);
```

##### Group-by clause

The `Pull` class provides basic abstraction for the `GROUP BY` clause.

```php
$pull->groupBy(['column_one', 'column_two']);
```

##### Limit clause

The `Pull` class provides basic abstraction for the `LIMIT` clause.
The first argument is the limit and the second argument is the offset.

```php
$pull->limit(10, 20);
```

The offset is `0` (zero) by default.

```php
$pull->limit(1);
```
