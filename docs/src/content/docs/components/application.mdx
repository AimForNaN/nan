At the core of every NaN application stands `NaN\App`.
It is a PSR-15-compatible request handler with support for services and middleware.
Upon running the application, all request data will be passed on to the middleware in exchange for a response.
The response will, therefrom, be processed to  be sent to the client.

```php title="index.php"
use NaN\App;

$app = new App();

$app->run();
```

### Services

Services can be conveniently and optionally registered through the `NaN\App` constructor.
It will accept any PSR-11-compatible containers.

```php
use NaN\DI\Container;

$app = new App(new Container([
	CustomServiceInterface::class => CustomService::class,
]));
```

Services can also be later registered through the array-access operator.
For this to work the service container that was provided in the `App` constructor must allow registration through array-access operators.

```php
$app[CustomServiceInterface::class] = CustomService::class;
```

If the service container is incompatible, a warning will be triggered.
You'll have to register your services through other means or stick to the NaN DI container.

##### Retrieving services

An instance of the service can be retrieved through the same array-access operator.

```php
$custom_service = $app[CustomService::class];
```

These services will be available only on an application level (or wherever the `Container` instance is used).
As such, the dependencies injected into the routes will come from the `App` instance that manages the route.
Any service you want access to from your routes should be registered through the NaN application instance.

### Middleware

Middleware can be conveniently and optionally registered through the `NaN\App` constructor.
It will accept any PSR-15-compatible request handlers.

```php
use NaN\App\Middleware;
use NaN\App\Middleware\Router;

$router = new Router();

$app = new App($services, new Middleware([
	$router,
]));
```

Middleware can also be later registered through the traditional `use` method.
For this to work the middleware container that was provided in the `App` constructor must allow registration through array-access operators.

```php
$app->use($middleware);
```

If the middleware container is incompatible, a warning will be triggered.
You'll have to register your middleware through other means or stick to the NaN middleware container.
