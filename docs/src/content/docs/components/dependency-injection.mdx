title: Dependency injection
---

Dependency injection is a way of dynamically injecting arguments into a callable.
In NaN, dependency injection is managed by the `NaN\DI` namespace.
At its core stands the `NaN\DI\Container` class, and functions as a PSR-11-compatible container system.

### Adding entries

You can conveniently and optionally add entries through the container's constructor.

```php
use NaN\DI\Container;

$container = new Container([
	SomeClassInterface::class => SomeClass::class,
]);
```

You can also use the array-access operator to add entries to the container.

```php
$container[SomeClassInterface::class] = SomeClass::class:
```

The array keys act as aliases.
When aliases are provided, look-up time achieves a complexity of O(1), so long as delegates are not involved.
Since all strings will be treated as fully-qualified class names, the string provided will be used as the alias when no alias is provided.

:::note

While aliases do not necessarily need to be fully-qualified class names,
	arbitrary aliases are only meaningful if you have direct access to the container instance, since they can't be used for type hinting.

### Retrieving entries

As per the PSR-11 standard, entries can be retrieved through the `get` method.

```php
$entry = $container->get($alias);
```

You can also use the array-access operator to retrieve an entry.

```php
$entry = $container[$alias];
```

If an entry was added without an alias, the system will be forced to loop through all entries until it finds the most compatible entry.
It will only be able to match against a class that inherits from the hinted type on a FIFO basis.
As per the PSR-11 standard, an exception will be thrown if an entry cannot be found when retrieving an entry.
Therefore, for best performance and predictability, be sure to always provide an alias and type hint using only that alias.

As per the same standard, you can check if an entry exists through the `has` method.

```php
if ($container->has($alias)) {
	$entry = $container->get($alias);
}
```

Or with the array-access operator.

```php
if (isset($container[$alias]) {
	$entry = $container->get($alias);
}
```

Or you can simply catch the exception.

```php
use Psr\Container\NotFoundExceptionInterface;

try {
	$entry = $container->get($alias);
} catch (NotFoundExceptionInterface $ex) {
	// ...
}
```

### Delegates

Delegates allow multiple containers to work together when retrieving entries.
When a container cannot find a matching entry it will delegate the task to another container.
Since there is no global store of containers, each container will store their own delegates.

```php
$first_container = new Container();

$second_container = new Container([
	SomeClassInterface::class => SomeClass::class,
]);

$first_container->addDelegate($second_container);

// Will search $second_container if an entry can't be found!
$first_container->get(SomeClassInterface::class);
```

### Factories

Sometimes you need a little extra boilerplate than your typical entry.
In such cases you can use a function to act as a factory.
The container instance can be accessed through `$this`.

```php
$container[SomeOtherClassInterface::class]
	= SomeOtherClass::class;

$container[SomeClassInterface::class] = function () {
	/** @var \NaN\DI\Container $this */
	$dependency = $this->get(SomeOtherClassInterface::class);
	// Do some stuff...
	return $some_class;
}:
```

### Single instance

Typically, when retrieving an entry a new instance will be instantiated for any given factory or fully-qualified class name.

```php
$one = $container[SomeClassInterface::class];
$two = $container[SomeClassInterface::class];

($one === $two) === false;
```

Sometimes you may want the same instance every time you retrieve an entry.
In such cases you should use real values.

```php
$container[SomeClassInterface::class] = new SomeClass();

$one = $container[SomeClassInterface::class];
$two = $container[SomeClassInterface::class];

($one === $two) === true;
```
